# Service workers and sensitive functions

Service workers are an essential component of Progressive web applications. They support offline loading, background code execution, and push notifications.

Our work outlines the misuse of service workers with sensitive JavaScript functions. To that extent, we developed an extension to notify users of registered service workers in their browsers, and extend it to show possible attacks that can be mounted.
